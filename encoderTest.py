  @brief Connect board with raspberryPi.
  @n Make board power and motor connection correct.
  @n Run this demo.
  @n Motor 1 will move slow to fast, orientation clockwise, 
  @n motor 2 will move fast to slow, orientation count-clockwise, 
  @n then fast to stop. loop in few seconds.
  @n Motor speed will print on terminal
